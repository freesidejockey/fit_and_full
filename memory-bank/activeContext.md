# Active Context

This file tracks the project's current status, including recent changes, current goals, and open questions.

2025-06-21 10:04:38 - Memory Bank initialization and current task analysis

## Current Focus

- **Recipe Directions Enhancement**: Converting simple string-based directions to a structured Step model system
- **Wizard Implementation Preparation**: Creating SwiftData models to support step-by-step recipe guidance
- **Data Model Architecture**: Designing the Step model with proper SwiftData relationships and wizard-friendly properties

## Recent Changes

- Memory Bank initialization to track architectural decisions and project context
- Analysis of current RecipeModels.swift structure showing string-based directions system
- Identification of need for Step model to replace directions string property

## Open Questions/Issues

- Migration strategy for existing string directions in sample data
- UI impact assessment for views currently displaying string directions
- Step model property requirements (timing, completion tracking, etc.)
- Backward compatibility considerations for existing direction displays

[2025-06-21 10:10:53] - Task completed: Recipe directions successfully converted to Step model system

- Step model now provides wizard-ready functionality with completion tracking and timing estimates
- Recipe model maintains backward compatibility while supporting new step-based workflow
- Sample data demonstrates proper Step usage with realistic cooking times
- Ready for wizard UI implementation in future development phases

[2025-06-21 10:22:00] - New Task: Recipe Details Page Architecture Design

- Designing comprehensive recipe details page with 4 modular sections plus bottom action
- Creating component-based architecture for header, time info, macros, and ingredients
- Planning data model extensions for timing information (prep, cook, rest times)
- Ensuring integration with existing Recipe/Ingredient models and app patterns

[2025-06-23 09:53:31] - UI Simplification: Remove Redundant Cancel Button from Cooking Wizard

- User identified redundancy between toolbar "Cancel" button and bottom "Exit Cooking" button
- Toolbar cancel button is sufficient for exit functionality
- Bottom navigation should focus on step navigation (Previous/Next) only
- Architectural decision to remove "Exit Cooking" button from CookingNavigationComponent
- Simplifies user interface and follows iOS design patterns
