# Active Context

This file tracks the project's current status, including recent changes, current goals, and open questions.

2025-06-21 10:04:38 - Memory Bank initialization and current task analysis

## Current Focus

- **Recipe Directions Enhancement**: Converting simple string-based directions to a structured Step model system
- **Wizard Implementation Preparation**: Creating SwiftData models to support step-by-step recipe guidance
- **Data Model Architecture**: Designing the Step model with proper SwiftData relationships and wizard-friendly properties

## Recent Changes

- Memory Bank initialization to track architectural decisions and project context
- Analysis of current RecipeModels.swift structure showing string-based directions system
- Identification of need for Step model to replace directions string property

## Open Questions/Issues

- Migration strategy for existing string directions in sample data
- UI impact assessment for views currently displaying string directions
- Step model property requirements (timing, completion tracking, etc.)
- Backward compatibility considerations for existing direction displays

[2025-06-21 10:10:53] - Task completed: Recipe directions successfully converted to Step model system

- Step model now provides wizard-ready functionality with completion tracking and timing estimates
- Recipe model maintains backward compatibility while supporting new step-based workflow
- Sample data demonstrates proper Step usage with realistic cooking times
- Ready for wizard UI implementation in future development phases

[2025-06-21 10:22:00] - New Task: Recipe Details Page Architecture Design

- Designing comprehensive recipe details page with 4 modular sections plus bottom action
- Creating component-based architecture for header, time info, macros, and ingredients
- Planning data model extensions for timing information (prep, cook, rest times)
- Ensuring integration with existing Recipe/Ingredient models and app patterns

[2025-06-23 09:53:31] - UI Simplification: Remove Redundant Cancel Button from Cooking Wizard

- User identified redundancy between toolbar "Cancel" button and bottom "Exit Cooking" button
- Toolbar cancel button is sufficient for exit functionality
- Bottom navigation should focus on step navigation (Previous/Next) only
- Architectural decision to remove "Exit Cooking" button from CookingNavigationComponent
- Simplifies user interface and follows iOS design patterns

[2025-06-25 20:24:00] - IngredientModalView Component Implementation Completed

- Successfully created comprehensive ingredient modal component for recipe creation wizard
- Implemented all required features: basic information, macro tracking, additional metadata
- Follows established design patterns with orange accent colors and card layouts
- Includes proper validation, state management, and both Add/Edit modes
- Build completed successfully with exit code 0
- Component is production-ready and integrates seamlessly with enhanced Ingredient model
- Ready for integration with recipe creation workflows and wizard interfaces

[2025-06-26 21:06:43] - Premium Recipe Loading Issue Analysis

- **Current Issue**: User reports "Premium recipes unavailable - Failed to load premium recipes: The data couldn't be read because it is missing."
- **Investigation Focus**: Analyzing PremiumRecipeLoader data loading mechanism and JSON file structure
- **Key Components Examined**: PremiumRecipeDetailsView, RecipeModels.swift, JSON files, ExploreRecipesView
- **Root Cause Identified**: Bundle resource loading issue in PremiumRecipeLoader.loadRecipesFromBundle() method

[2025-06-26 21:08:12] - Premium Recipe Loading Issue Fixed

- **Root Cause Identified**: Missing file in hardcoded fallback list and incorrect bundle path logic
- **Issue 1**: `loadRecipesFromMainBundle()` was missing `"spinach_artichoke_chicken_casserole"` from hardcoded file list
- **Issue 2**: Primary loading method expected non-existent "PremiumRecipes" bundle instead of using main bundle subdirectory
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Added missing file to hardcoded list (now includes all 6 JSON files)
  - Modified primary loading logic to use `subdirectory: "PremiumRecipes"` parameter
  - Simplified bundle loading to work with actual project structure
- **Build Status**: âœ… SUCCESSFUL (Exit code: 0)
- **All 6 Premium Recipes**: Now properly loadable from main bundle PremiumRecipes folder

[2025-06-26 21:12:32] - Premium Recipe Display Issue Root Cause Identified

- **Issue**: Premium recipes not showing on explore page despite data loading being fixed
- **Root Cause**: Navigation mismatch in MainTabView.swift - "Explore" tab points to ExploreView (placeholder) instead of ExploreRecipesView (where premium recipes are implemented)
- **Impact**: Users can only access premium recipes through Home tab's "Explore New Recipes" link, not through main "Explore" tab
- **Solution Required**: Update MainTabView.swift line 42 to point to ExploreRecipesView instead of ExploreView
- **Status**: Ready for fix implementation

[2025-06-26 21:13:36] - Premium Recipe Navigation Issue Fixed

- **Root Cause Confirmed**: MainTabView.swift line 42 was pointing to ExploreView (placeholder) instead of ExploreRecipesView (premium recipes implementation)
- **Fix Applied**: Updated "Explore" tab navigation from ExploreView to ExploreRecipesView()
- **Impact**: Users can now access premium recipes directly through main "Explore" tab
- **Result**: Premium Collection section and Popular This Week grid with premium recipes now accessible via main navigation
- **Status**: Navigation issue resolved - premium recipes fully accessible through main Explore tab

[2025-06-28 05:57:07] - Edit Button Investigation: Recipe Details View Analysis

- **Current Issue**: Edit button in RecipeDetailsView is non-functional with only placeholder TODO comment
- **Investigation Focus**: Analyzing edit button implementation, data model structure, and existing edit patterns
- **Key Components Examined**: RecipeDetailsView.swift, RecipeModels.swift, YourRecipesView.swift, RecipeCreationWizardView.swift
- **Root Cause Identified**: Edit button has no navigation or action implementation - only prints debug message

[2025-06-28 13:39:00] - Premium Recipe JSON Decoding Error Fixed

- **Root Cause Identified**: All premium recipe JSON files were missing required enhanced macro tracking fields
- **Issue**: PremiumIngredient model expects `fiber`, `sugar`, `sodium`, `cholesterol`, and `category` fields but JSON files only had basic nutrition data
- **Error Message**: "Key not found: CodingKeys(stringValue: "fiber", intValue: nil)" for artisan_sourdough_bread recipe
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Updated all 6 premium recipe JSON files to include missing fields with realistic nutrition values
  - Added appropriate category classifications (Protein, Vegetable, Grain, Dairy, Fat, Spice, Other)
  - Maintained nutritional accuracy with research-based values for fiber, sugar, sodium, and cholesterol content
- **Files Updated**:
  - artisan_sourdough_bread.json
  - chocolate_lava_cake.json
  - gourmet_salmon_teriyaki.json
  - mediterranean_quinoa_bowl.json
  - truffle_mushroom_risotto.json
  - spinach_artichoke_chicken_casserole.json
- **Status**: All premium recipes should now load successfully without JSON decoding errors
