# Progress

This file tracks the project's progress using a task list format.

2025-06-21 10:04:56 - Initial progress tracking setup

## Completed Tasks

- Project structure analysis and understanding of current RecipeModels.swift implementation
- Memory Bank initialization with productContext.md and activeContext.md
- Architectural planning for Step model to replace string-based directions

## Current Tasks

- Create Step SwiftData model with wizard-friendly properties
- Update Recipe model to use Step relationship instead of directions string
- Modify sample data to use Step objects instead of string directions
- Ensure backward compatibility with computed properties

## Next Steps

- Implement Step model with proper SwiftData annotations
- Update Recipe model relationships and remove directions string property
- Convert existing sample recipe directions to Step objects
- Test data model changes and relationships
- Document migration approach for existing data

[2025-06-21 10:10:21] - Step model implementation completed successfully

- Created Step SwiftData model with wizard-friendly properties (id, stepNumber, instruction, isCompleted, estimatedTime)
- Updated Recipe model to use Step relationship instead of directions string
- Added backward compatibility with directionsText computed property
- Implemented helper methods for step management and wizard functionality
- Updated all sample data to use Step objects with realistic timing estimates
- Added Equatable conformance for Step model consistency

[2025-06-21 10:23:07] - Recipe Details Page Architecture Planning

## Completed Tasks

- Analyzed current project structure and existing Recipe/Ingredient models
- Reviewed existing RecipeDetailsView placeholder implementation
- Studied RecipePreviewComponent patterns for consistency
- Designed comprehensive component-based architecture for recipe details page
- Planned data model extensions for timing information
- Documented architectural decisions and component responsibilities

## Current Tasks

- Create detailed component specifications for each section
- Plan Recipe model extensions for timing data (prepTime, cookTime, restTime)
- Design component interfaces and data binding patterns
- Specify integration points with existing navigation and color systems

## Next Steps

- Switch to Code mode to implement the component architecture
- Extend Recipe model with timing properties and sample data updates
- Create individual SwiftUI components (Header, TimeInfo, Macro, Ingredients)
- Implement main RecipeDetailsView container with proper layout
- Add comprehensive preview support for all components
- Test component integration and responsive design

[2025-06-21 10:31:12] - Recipe Details Page Implementation Completed

## Completed Tasks

- Extended Recipe model with timing properties (prepTime, cookTime, restTime) and formatted display methods
- Updated sample data with realistic timing information for all recipes
- Created RecipeHeaderComponent with navigation, edit, and favorite functionality
- Implemented RecipeTimeInfoComponent with circular time indicators for prep/cook/rest times
- Built RecipeMacroComponent displaying nutrition information per serving in clean grid layout
- Developed RecipeIngredientsComponent with serving adjustment controls and grocery list integration
- Redesigned RecipeDetailsView as main container orchestrating all components
- Updated ExploreRecipesView and YourRecipesView to navigate to new RecipeDetailsView
- All components include comprehensive preview support for individual testing

## Current Status

- Recipe details page architecture fully implemented with modular component system
- All 4 required sections plus bottom action button completed as specified
- Navigation integration completed across existing views
- Components ready for future wizard and grocery list functionality integration

[2025-06-21 10:36:22] - Fixed Tab Bar Visibility Issue

- Added `.toolbar(.hidden, for: .tabBar)` modifier to RecipeDetailsView
- Applied to both main recipe view and fallback nil recipe view
- Recipe details page now displays without bottom tab bar for better user experience
- Navigation structure properly isolates recipe details from main tab navigation

[2025-06-21 10:45:53] - Updated Navigation to Standard iOS System

- Removed custom RecipeHeaderComponent from toolbar
- Implemented standard iOS navigation with .navigationTitle("Recipe")
- Moved recipe title and action buttons (favorite, edit) below navigation header as separate section
- Recipe title now displays as large title in content area
- Action buttons styled as bordered buttons with icons and text
- Maintains tab bar hiding for focused recipe viewing experience
- Uses standard iOS back button behavior automatically
