[2025-06-28 06:30:21] - CookingWizardView "Finish Cooking" Button Issue Fixed

## Completed Tasks

- **Root Cause Identified**: CookingNavigationComponent.swift Next button became disabled on last step instead of changing to "Finish Cooking"
- **Issue Analysis**:
  - `canGoNext` property returned false when `currentStepIndex == totalSteps - 1` (last step)
  - Button text was hardcoded as "Next" regardless of step position
  - Button action only advanced to next step, didn't handle completion flow
  - Button styling remained orange instead of green for completion
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Added `isLastStep` computed property to detect last step: `currentStepIndex == totalSteps - 1`
  - Modified button text: "Next" → "Finish Cooking" on last step
  - Updated button icon: "chevron.right" → "checkmark" on last step
  - Changed button action: advances to `currentStepIndex = totalSteps` on last step (triggers completion screen)
  - Updated button styling: orange → green background on last step
  - Removed `.disabled(!canGoNext)` - button now always enabled
- **Integration**: Button now properly advances to completion screen in CookingWizardView when `currentStep` returns nil
- **User Experience**: Users see enabled green "Finish Cooking" button on last step instead of disabled "Next" button

## Technical Implementation

- Modified [`CookingNavigationComponent.swift`](Fit&Full/View/CookingNavigationComponent.swift:39) lines 39-47 and 143-171
- Added `isLastStep` computed property for last step detection
- Updated button logic to handle both navigation and completion flows
- Maintained existing animation and styling patterns
- Preserved all existing functionality for non-last steps

  - Ensures step completion persists via SwiftData when user clicks "Next"
  - Only marks steps complete for regular navigation (not when finishing cooking)
  - Maintains existing animation and navigation flow

- **CookingWizardView.swift Progress Reset**: Added progress reset functionality for both cancel and finish actions
  - **Cancel Action** (line 110): Added `recipe.resetCookingProgress()` before `dismiss()` in exit confirmation
  - **Finish Action** (line 67): Added `recipe.resetCookingProgress()` before `dismiss()` in completion screen
  - Uses existing `resetCookingProgress()` method that resets all step completion states and recipe progress to 0
  - Ensures clean state for next cooking session

## Technical Implementation

- **Step Completion Logic**: Automatic marking occurs before step advancement, ensuring current step is completed when user progresses
- **Progress Reset Integration**: Leverages existing `Recipe.resetCookingProgress()` method that:
  - Resets all `Step.isCompleted` to false
  - Resets all ingredient completion states
  - Sets `cookingProgress` to 0.0
  - Clears `lastCookedDate`
- **Data Persistence**: Changes persist via SwiftData model updates

[2025-06-28 11:30:00] - RecipePreviewComponent Spacing Consistency Fix Completed

## Completed Tasks

- **Standardized Vertical Padding**: Added `.padding(.vertical, 5)` to ensure consistent spacing across all RecipePreviewComponent usage patterns

  - **YourRecipesView.swift**: Added vertical padding to grid container (line 128) to match HomeTabView horizontal scrolling cards
  - **ExploreRecipesView.swift**: Added vertical padding to both grid containers (lines 98 and 145) for Featured Recipes and Popular This Week sections
  - **Result**: All recipe preview components now have consistent breathing room regardless of layout context (horizontal scrolling vs grid)

- **Fixed Bottom Spacing Inconsistency**: Updated ExploreRecipesView bottom spacer for proper tab bar clearance
  - **ExploreRecipesView.swift**: Changed `Spacer(minLength: 20)` to `Spacer(minLength: 100)` (line 167)
  - **Result**: Consistent tab bar clearance across all views, preventing content from being cut off

## Technical Implementation

- **Spacing Standardization**: All RecipePreviewComponent instances now have uniform `.padding(.vertical, 5)` for consistent visual spacing
- **Tab Bar Clearance**: Standardized bottom spacing to `Spacer(minLength: 100)` across HomeTabView, YourRecipesView, and ExploreRecipesView
- **Layout Consistency**: Ensures recipe cards have identical spacing whether displayed in horizontal scrolling or grid layouts
- **User Experience**: Eliminates visual inconsistencies that could confuse users across different views

## Current Status

- Spacing inconsistencies in RecipePreviewComponent usage fully resolved
- All views now provide consistent visual experience for recipe browsing
- Tab bar clearance standardized to prevent content overlap
- Ready for testing and user interaction

[2025-06-28 12:59:05] - HomeTabView Recipe Ideas Section Implementation Completed

## Completed Tasks

- **Added New "Recipe Ideas" Section**: Created a new section between "Your Recipes" and "Explore New Recipes" sections in HomeTabView.swift
  - **Section Header**: Added "Recipe Ideas" title with "Try These" subtitle for visual hierarchy
  - **Horizontal Scrolling Layout**: Implemented horizontal ScrollView with HStack layout matching existing "Your Recipes" pattern
  - **Sample Recipe Display**: Shows first 3 sample recipes from `Recipe.sampleRecipes` (Protein Pancakes, Green Smoothie, Breakfast Casserole)
  - **Purple/Blue Color Theme**: Used alternating `.purpleLightBackground` and `.blueLightBackground` for visual variety (different from orange theme)
  - **Navigation Integration**: Added NavigationLink to RecipeDetailsView for each sample recipe card
  - **Consistent Styling**: Used existing RecipePreviewComponent with fixed width (160x160) for proper horizontal scrolling
  - **Proper Spacing**: Added 15-point spacing between cards and 20-point horizontal padding

## Technical Implementation

- **Layout Structure**: Added `recipeIdeasSection` and `recipeIdeasGrid` computed properties following existing patterns
- **Recipe Selection**: Uses `Array(sampleRecipes.prefix(3))` to display first 3 sample recipes
- **Color Alternation**: Implements purple/blue alternating pattern with `index % 2 == 0` logic
- **Touch Handling**: Applied `.buttonStyle(PlainButtonStyle())` for proper navigation interaction
- **Responsive Design**: Maintains consistent spacing and layout across iOS screen sizes

## Current Status

- Recipe Ideas section successfully integrated into HomeTabView
- Displays sample recipes even when user has no personal recipes
