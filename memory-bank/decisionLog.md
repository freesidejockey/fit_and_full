# Decision Log

This file records architectural and implementation decisions using a list format.

2025-06-21 10:05:11 - Initial decision log creation

## Decision

Replace Recipe.directions String property with Step model relationship for wizard-based recipe guidance

## Rationale

- **Enhanced User Experience**: Step-by-step wizard interface provides better cooking guidance than single text block
- **Progress Tracking**: Individual steps can be marked complete, providing clear progress indication
- **Extensibility**: Step model allows future enhancements like timing, images, or sub-steps
- **SwiftData Integration**: Proper model relationships maintain data integrity and enable efficient queries
- **Backward Compatibility**: Computed properties can still provide string representation when needed

## Implementation Details

- Create new Step SwiftData model with properties: id, stepNumber, instruction, isCompleted, estimatedTime, recipe relationship
- Update Recipe model to replace directions: String with @Relationship var steps: [Step]
- Add computed property directionsText to Recipe for backward compatibility
- Convert existing sample data string directions to Step objects
- Maintain proper SwiftData relationship annotations with cascade delete rules
- Ensure step ordering through stepNumber property for consistent wizard flow

[2025-06-21 10:22:33] - Recipe Details Page Component Architecture

## Decision

Implement recipe details page as modular component system with 4 distinct sections plus bottom action button

## Rationale

- **Modularity**: Each section (header, time info, macros, ingredients) as separate SwiftUI components enables independent development and testing
- **Reusability**: Components can be reused in other contexts (recipe editing, recipe creation, etc.)
- **Maintainability**: Separation of concerns makes code easier to maintain and modify
- **Preview Support**: Individual component previews facilitate rapid UI development
- **Future Integration**: Component structure supports planned wizard and grocery list features

## Implementation Details

- Create RecipeDetailsView as main container with ScrollView layout
- Implement RecipeHeaderComponent with navigation and action buttons
- Build RecipeTimeInfoComponent with circular time indicators for prep/cook/rest
- Design RecipeMacroComponent leveraging existing nutrition calculations
- Create RecipeIngredientsComponent with serving adjustment and grocery list integration
- Extend Recipe model with timing properties (prepTime, cookTime, restTime)
- Use established app color system and component patterns for consistency

[2025-06-22 11:06:45] - SwiftData Persistence Implementation for Recipe Creation

## Decision

Implement complete SwiftData persistence for CreateRecipeView with proper error handling and data flow integration

## Rationale

- **Data Persistence**: Users need their created recipes to persist between app sessions
- **User Experience**: Immediate feedback on save operations with loading states and error handling
- **Data Integrity**: Proper SwiftData relationships ensure all recipe components (ingredients, steps) are saved together
- **Integration**: Seamless flow from recipe creation to viewing in YourRecipesView
- **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive error handling prevents data loss and provides user feedback

## Implementation Details

- Added Step.self to ModelContainer configuration in Fit_FullApp.swift for complete model coverage
- Implemented @Environment(\.modelContext) injection in CreateRecipeView for SwiftData access
- Created comprehensive save functionality with try-catch error handling
- Added loading states (isSaving) with disabled button and progress indicator during save operations
- Implemented dual alert system for validation errors and save errors
- Updated YourRecipesView to use @Query instead of static sample data
- Added empty state handling with sample data loading option for better user onboarding
- Established complete data flow: CreateRecipeView → SwiftData → YourRecipesView display

[2025-06-22 11:59:09] - Premium Recipe System Architecture Implementation

## Decision

Implement comprehensive JSON-based premium recipe system with lock/unlock functionality for future paywall integration

## Rationale

- **Monetization Foundation**: Establishes infrastructure for premium content monetization without requiring immediate paywall implementation
- **Content Management**: JSON-based approach allows easy content updates and recipe additions without app store releases
- **User Experience**: Provides immediate value through curated premium recipes while preparing users for premium features
- **Technical Scalability**: Modular architecture supports future enhancements and integrations
- **Performance**: Efficient caching and lazy loading ensure smooth user experience

## Implementation Details

**Data Architecture**

- Created [`PremiumRecipe`](Fit&Full/Model/RecipeModels.swift:14), [`PremiumIngredient`](Fit&Full/Model/RecipeModels.swift:126), and [`PremiumStep`](Fit&Full/Model/RecipeModels.swift:153) models with full Codable conformance
- Implemented comprehensive nutrition calculations and time formatting
- Added [`toRecipe()`](Fit&Full/Model/RecipeModels.swift:88) conversion method for cooking wizard integration
- Designed extensible JSON schema for future feature additions

**Service Layer**

- Built [`PremiumRecipeLoader`](Fit&Full/Model/RecipeModels.swift:168) as ObservableObject for reactive UI updates
- Implemented robust JSON parsing with multiple fallback mechanisms
- Added caching system for performance optimization
- Created automatic recipe file discovery and loading

**UI Integration**

- Developed [`PremiumRecipePreviewComponent`](Fit&Full/View/PremiumRecipePreviewComponent.swift) with lock/unlock visual indicators
- Created [`PremiumRecipeDetailsView`](Fit&Full/View/PremiumRecipeDetailsView.swift) with modular component architecture
- Integrated premium recipes into [`ExploreRecipesView`](Fit&Full/View/ExploreRecipesView.swift) with proper navigation
- Maintained consistent styling with existing app design patterns

**Sample Data Strategy**

- Created 5 diverse premium recipes covering different categories and difficulty levels
- Implemented mix of locked/unlocked recipes to demonstrate paywall functionality
- Included realistic nutrition data and cooking times for authentic user experience
- Designed recipes with varied complexity to showcase system capabilities

**Future-Proofing**

- Established [`unlockRecipe(withId:)`](Fit&Full/Model/RecipeModels.swift:273) foundation for server-side paywall integration
- Created visual and interaction patterns ready for premium upgrade flows
- Built modular architecture supporting easy feature additions
- Implemented scalable file structure for content management
